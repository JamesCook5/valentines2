          To start off our little record of memories, i'm going to go over all
          the times we've took photos together because they tend to be my
          favourite. No matter where they are taken, they always remind me of
          our connection.

          me that weve grown together, Bit of a stupid metaphor but the photos
          that came from me were on a poo phone and look at our progression.

          enjoyed this walk even though i was coughing up a storm, the little
          conversations we had and sight seeing we did was amazing.

          couple we are.

          close to me just because its quite well taken to be fair. perfect
          heart shape paired with my forehead what could go wrong. I could of
          picked the photo of you kissing me but i've done so before so gonna

          The arundel lake is a place to be, whenever we ride it and almost die
          i secretly love it because its always a beautiful view no matter what.
          When we kissed under that little tree by the hut I actually felt like
          we were in the notebook. Talking about that little hut...

          funnily enough it also it seems like the fact that we wrote our
          initials then a year later we added another heart came straight out of
          a movie like the notebook or the titanic too. I hope its still there
          for another trip after our GCSEs in the summer.

          It's funny how your older phone managed to capture such an ethereal
          picture that could be in a magazine somewhere. The cherry on top is
          that the castle is so beatiful, maybe itll be worth it to spend the
          fortune to wander inside it!

          bit of a trend now with the arundel pics but this is the last one. And
          what a last image it is, pure green water with a lil duck swimming
          around it's so cute. We have to just stroll around arundel again
          please

          Can't be a beautiful place memoir without our france trip. This is
          definitely up there with my favourites and it would be in there if
          your arms weren't asking me a question. I picked this one because it
          has you and my sister and you two are very important to me so I love
          it. Cant forget to mention the perfect mountains in the back damn.

          underrated little pic of the bird that stole your heart in the oldest
          cafe in geneva. ths sign is really well designed and when i was
          scrolling through my camera roll picking pictures to use in this
          little montage it struck out to me. Pretty, unique, things like these
          remind me of you.

        The ultimate 3. The first one is my favourite. that picture along with
        the picture on the first valentine website are my 2 favourites. Mainly
        because they're so recent and becuase we both look good ( you look out
        of this world) for once. Normally its only you, especially since its
        vintage. The second picture is adorable with the view of that little
        village of our mountain top village and the distant mountains crafting a
        background. That image embodies to me what it feels like to be free. The
        third image may be a bit suprising since you sent it to me like 3 hours
        ago, but you look so pretty i had to include it. I've never seen a women
        look so gorgeous with ease and i can't wait to see you with that on in
        real life.
